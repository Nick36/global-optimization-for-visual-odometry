Abstract

The recently developed direct sparse odometry framework DSO stands apart among all recent research on monocular visual odometry with its robustness and precision. It accumulates, however, considerable motion drift over the course of loops in the trajectory because it only employs local window optimization. We have recognized that a loop detection mechanism providing constraints for global keyframe pose optimization could reduce this motion drift and thus make the trajectory estimate globally consistent. We have therefore developed a global optimization layer for DSO, which initializes the variables of a factor graph with the DSO pose estimates for all keyframes, connects them whenever possible with photometric factors  for further optimizing or between pose factors for maintaining their relative poses and enforces between pose constraints upon loop detections for eliminating the drift accumulated over the course of loops in the trajectory. We have hence defined our custom photometric factors for the optimization of a direct global energy formulation inspired by the photometric local optimization window energy defined in DSO and implemented its global optimization by means of the incremental smoothing and mapping algorithm iSAM2 from the GTSAM factor graph optimization library. We have also developed a loop detection mechanism building upon existing approaches for image matching based on ORB feature descriptors stored in a DBoW2 keyframe database and performing a geometric consistency check to filter out pairs of keyframes, for which a between pose constraint  imposing a reliable rigid body transformation estimate is to be added to the factor graph. An evaluation of our method against DSO and the prominent simultaneous localization and mapping system ORB-SLAM shows its superiority in regard to the absolute trajectory and the relative pose error of its trajectory estimates for a monocular visual odometry dataset.
