Global keyframe-based optimization of the keyframe pose estimates delivered by DSO


Dependancies and CMake:

We have locally installed specific versions of some libraries ensuring their compatibility with each other.

The Eigen version we employ is 3.2.5 built from source (available at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=News:Eigen_3.2.5_released!) for compatibility with the GTSAM library under the tag 4.0.0-alpha1.

A library decsription and the installation steps for Polyclipping can be found at http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php

Let <LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR> be the directory, in which you locally install libraries.

The installation steps for OpenCV with extra modules are the following:

cd <LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR>
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
cd opencv
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR>/opencv_contrib/modules -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR>/local ..
make -j6
make install

The installation steps for GTSAM are the following:

cd <LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR>
git clone https://bitbucket.org/gtborg/gtsam.git
git reset --hard 4.0.0-alpha1
cd gtsam
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR>/local ..
make -j6
make install

You should also install the OpenCV, GTSAM, Eigen and Polyclipping libraries and set the LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR variable in the <dso>/CMakeLists.txt and <dso>/thirdparty/DBoW2/CMakeLists.txt files to match their installation directory, where <dso> is your DSO installation directory.

Furthermore, you need to extract the file <dso>/code/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt.tar.gz into the <dso>/code/Vocabulary/ directory.

To compile the DSO executable, issue the following commands:

cd <dso>/thirdparty/DBoW2/
make -j6

cd <dso>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j6


Notes on the code: 

This is an enhancement of the code from the original DSO publication by Engel et al. available at https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso. 

The files <dso>/code/src/FullSystem/ORBextractor.cpp and <dso>/code/src/FullSystem/ORBextractor.h, as well as <dso>/code/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt.tar.gz, are taken from the ORB-SLAM2 code available at https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.

The main contribution written by Nikolay Paleshnikov and pertaining to a global trajectory optimization as decribed in his Bachelor thesis "Global Keyfame-Based Optimization for a Direct Sparse Visual Odometry Approach" encompasses the file <dso>/code/src/FullSystem/LoopClosing.cpp, as well as all code snippets preceded by a //DSSLAM comment line throughout the rest of the code. 


For more details on the options and dependancies of DSO, we refer to the DSO\ README.txt file in the same directory.

For detailed explanation of the evaluation scripts, take note of README.md in the ./ATE\ and\ RPE\ evaluation directory.
